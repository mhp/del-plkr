del-plkr
========

This project will retrieve a list of del.icio.us bookmarks, tagged
with the tag 'plkr', and pass them to Plucker to create an offline
readable version.  The bookmark on del.icio.us will be updated to
remove the tag 'plkr' once the bookmark has been processed.

The code is heavily based upon DeliciousSnaflr, by Natalie Downe
(see http://notes.natbat.net/2007/03/06/delicioussnaflr/), and so
is released under the same license - the MIT license.  See the
following link for license details:
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php

At this stage, there is no support for actually invoking Plucker
on the bookmark!
